 10 members of ASEAN, as well as the collective grouping, have correctly refrained from responding to the summit between Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean supreme leader Kim Jong-un. While the United States and its Asian military allies, Japan and South Korea, strongly condemned the meeting, ASEAN has avoided unnecessary misunderstanding that could escalate tensions in the region.

Dynamics in the region has been complex. East Asian nations are the most strategic partners for ASEAN in terms of economy, security and defense. Leaders in this region tend to maintain a certain level of understanding about the desperate moves of Putin and Kim, who are facing isolation from the international community.

ASEAN will have an opportunity to get firsthand information from various sides about the summit when it hosts the annual ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) in Vientiane on July 27. The ARF is internationally recognized as one of the worldâ€™s most powerful forums, especially regarding the situation in East Asia and the South China Sea.

The ARF gathers the 10 ASEAN member states and their 10 dialogue partners: the US, China, Japan, Canada, India, South Korea, Russia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the European Union, as well as other countries in the region such as Papua New Guinea, Mongolia, North Korea, Pakistan, Timor-Leste, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka as observers.

The upcoming forum will give outgoing Foreign Minister Retno LP Marsudi an opportunity to talk to both her Russian and North Korean counterparts, although North Korea rarely attended the previous ARFs. Nevertheless, the forum is an excellent place to discuss the latest situation in East Asia, including conflicts and tensions among parties.
