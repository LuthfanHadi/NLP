I currently work as technical support at a large company. This job is challenging and requires proficient technical skills, but I am aware that this role could be replaced by AI technology in the near future. Therefore, I feel the need to continuously develop myself and utilize the skills I already have, especially in Python programming, to seek more promising and sustainable career opportunities.

I have internship experience at a startup specializing in face recognition, where I learned and applied various techniques in computer vision using Python. This experience was invaluable and provided me with an in-depth understanding of how computer vision technology can be implemented in various practical applications, such as security, facial recognition, and image analysis. During the internship, I worked on several challenging projects that not only honed my technical skills but also enhanced my ability to work in a team and collaborate with experts in the field.

Additionally, while working as a System Engineer, I used my Python programming skills to process monthly data used by our company's finance division for billing our partners. This data is crucial for the monthly billing process. This task required me to manage and analyze data effectively and present it in an easily understandable format for the finance team. I had to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the generated data, as even the smallest error could significantly impact the company's financial reports. This experience taught me the importance of precision and integrity in data processing.

With this background, I do not want to waste my skills and interest in Python programming and data processing. I see numerous opportunities in the field of data analysis and data science that not only offer job stability but also allow me to continue learning and growing. Therefore, I am seeking opportunities to transition my career from technical support to data analyst or data scientist. I believe these fields provide greater stability in the future and offer more significant opportunities to contribute to technological innovation.

In my search for better career opportunities, I discovered that Purwadhika is one of the most renowned and recommended bootcamps for individuals looking to change or enhance their careers in technology. After reading more about the programs offered by Purwadhika, particularly for data analyst and data science, I am very interested in enrolling in this program.

Moreover, I also found that Purwadhika offers a scholarship program for studying there. This scholarship program presents a great opportunity for me to pursue my dream without worrying about educational costs. With my background and experience, I hope to qualify for this scholarship and start a new journey in data analysis and data science. I believe that this program will provide me with deeper knowledge and skills in data analysis and data science, which will strengthen my competence and open up more career opportunities in the future.

I am very enthusiastic about learning more and developing myself in this dynamic field. By attending the program at Purwadhika, I am confident that I can master the various techniques and tools needed to become a competent data analyst or data scientist. I am ready to face new challenges and contribute to technological innovation through more advanced and accurate data analysis. I hope to join the Purwadhika program soon and begin a new chapter in my career.

With dedication and a passion for continuous learning, I am confident that I can achieve success in my new career as a data analyst or data scientist. I believe that this step is the right move for my future, and I am very excited to see what I will accomplish in this field.
